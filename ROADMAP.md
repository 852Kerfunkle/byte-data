# Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan from a high level and will be updated as progress is made.

Please feel free to file issues on this repository if you have questions, concerns or suggestions.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rochars/byte-data/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about how to contribute to this project.

## Planned:
- *packString()* should return a *Array*, both to conform with the pack() method for numbers and to avoid the need of polyfills in the ES3 dist.
- Include BE tests in the build process (now they need to be done manually)
- Include browser tests in the build process (now they need to be done manually)
- Add a browser compatibility badge to README
